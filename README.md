# Home Assistant Addons
This is a repository of Home Assistant addons that I find useful.  I make no promise to update, bug fix, or continue supporting any of these addons.  I created them because they are useful to me.  Feel free to fork and modify them as you see fit.  If you want to submit pull requests I am happy to merge them if they work for me.
